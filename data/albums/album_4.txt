The years I put into this

It could take a second
To tear down years of work
And we won't get these days
Back again (back again)
I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me
And the words roll over and over
Yet our hearts will never be lifted
Someone, tell me how I've ended up here
With nobody watching over me?
We need to bring back the days we used to love
Before all the colour drains away
I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me
I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me
To all those not living in the here and now
To all those not living in the here and now
To all those not living in the here and now
To all those (sing it loud)
Where did they go?
The days we used to know
Where did they go?
Have I forgotten what it feels like?
Where did they go / where did they go
The days we used to know
Where did they go / where did they go
Have I forgotten what it feels like?
And the words roll over and over
Yet our hearts will never be lifted




Picked yourself up,
Stop loving, start living,
Don't get held back,
That's where they want you to be.

I never paid much attention to them.

Every time they pushed us aside,
We got back up again,
Yeah we made it through the rain,
Just to live another day without them.

Pick yourself back up and learn to live,
Stop caring, stop thinking.
Picked yourself back up and learn to live,
The grass is greener on the other side, so don't give up on life.

Never back down, do this for yourself,
You don't need anyone to get you where you deserve.

I never paid much attention to them.

Every time they push us aside,
We jump back up again,
Yeah, we made it through the rain,
Just to live another day without them.

Every time they push us aside,
We jump back up again,
Yeah, we made it through the rain,
Just to live another day without them.

We are the ones you left out in the rain,
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.
We are the ones you left out in the rain,
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.

We are the ones you left out in the rain,
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.
We are the ones you left out in the rain,
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.

Here again...

We made it through the rain just to live another day,
We made it through the rain just to live another day,
We made it through the rain just to live another day,
We made it through the rain, the rain.




We are the misguided youth.
They backed us into a corner.
All our lives we've been infected,
They should have never of had a chance.

Because they're forcing us to believe,
In a world we shouldn't trust.
Delete rewind,
And try to change this state of mind.

Give us something to believe in,
Give us something to make our own,
Give us something to believe in,
Give us something to make our own.

When we will we stand up and choose our paths?

This is the end of the world,
At least that's what we're told.
This is the end of the world,
Board up your windows and lock the doors.

Turn out the lights, turn out the lights,
Oh, this is getting old.

We are the misguided youth,
We sat back and lost our voices.

Delete rewind,
Try to change this state of mind,
Delete rewind,
And try to change this...

Because they're pushing us to the left,
In a world we shouldn't trust.
Delete rewind,
And try to change this state of mind.

I don't believe you knew it all, you knew it all along.
Delete rewind, delete rewind.

When will we stand up,
We've been through enough.
When will we stand up,
How'd we let them get the best of us?

When will we stand up,
We've been through enough.
When will we stand up,
How'd we let them take the best of us?




It’s run down
The back of my head
The back of my mind
About a hundred thousand times
And I can’t
Seem to shake it
Seem to shake it
Addiction's tying me down

Pull me under
I can’t take it much longer
Pull me under
And it will never stop

You’ve got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I’ve been through this patch before
You’ve got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I’ve been through this patch before
I’ve been through this patch before

I’m lost and alone in my head
And I can’t make sense of myself
I need to find a simple away
To make this pain just disappear
I know I'll never feel
Safe in my own skin

Pull me under
I can’t take it much longer
Pull me under
And it will never stop

You’ve got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I’ve been through this patch before

You’ve got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I’ve been through this patch before

No matter how long I’m gone for
It’s at the back of my mind
Another sleepless night
Somebody get me home

I’m so far down
And there’s anyone can say to me
I’m so down, I’m so down

You’ve got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I’ve been through this patch before




Always the one with a face on
Always the one with never enough
He was the boy that broke your trust
Because he was never around enough
We sit around and hear these stories
Wishing we were somewhere else
How I wish that I could find the words to save this

My so called friend
My so called friend
When will we see you again

I was the one with the face on
I was the one with never enough
I was the boy that broke your trust
Because I was never around enough
I sit around and tell these stories
Wishing I was somewhere else
Oh how I wish I found the words to save this

My so called friend
My so called friend

I wish I found the words to save this
I’m pushing it out, out
Find the words to save this
I’m pushing it out, out, out

My so called friend
My so called friend
When will we see you again

My so called friend
My so called friend
When will we see you again
When will we see you again




Never, never lose sight
Of what you started it for
No matter what comes in between

And I used to think
That I knew better than those around me
But something changed along the way
And you’re the reason I’m wanting to stay

I used to sink and now I swim
I’ve had to work for everything

When will you recognize your it, you’re the reason I feel so alive
And none else comes in between

I used to think
That I knew better than those around me
But something changed along the way
And you’re the reason I’m wanting to stay

I can’t turn my back and leave you
After all you’ve done for me
I can’t turn my back and leave you
After all you’ve done for me

The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me and I can’t make sense of it
The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me
I wish it was you instead
The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me and I can’t make sense of it
The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me

Oh how I wish it was you instead

I never knew I could feel like this

The blues have wrapped their arms
Oh how I wish it was you instead
The blues have wrapped their arms
Oh how I wish it was you instead
The blues have wrapped their arms
Oh how I wish it was you instead




I can’t
Seem to get a hold of this
This mess
Seems to be taking
Its grasp on every
Everything that we once worked for
And I can’t bear to watch
Everything just fall around me,

And I’ve been struggling for so long
So long
And I’ve been
Looking for away
To make everything fall into place

And when the red glazes over my eyes
There’s nothing anyone can say or do
Just you try and stop me
Try and stop what I’ve have become how I wish there was a way.

And I’ve been struggling for so long
So long
And I’ve been
Looking for away
To make everything fall into place

Everything just fall into place
Every word I ever said
Is making sense again
When the red glazes over my eyes
There’s nothing anyone can say or
Say or do

And still today I cannot tell
The dream's from nightmares anymore
And still today I cannot tell
The dream's from nightmares anymore
And still today cannot tell
The dream's from nightmares anymore

If you reject the ones you love,
You’ll find yourself cold and broken again
If you reject the ones you love,
You’ll find yourself cold and broken again
If you reject the ones you love,
You’ll find yourself cold and broken again
If you reject the ones you love,
You’ll find yourself cold and broken again




You've done this to yourself or so, so it seems
You left behind everything
All your friends and all your family
Does it not feel slightly daunting
How you still sleep at night
When you must be able to hear them fight
It's all about you
All about you
All about the way you choose to live

You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough
You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough

How did it come to this

Is there any point to this, are you even listening to us

You still left everyone you loved
Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half
You still left everyone you loved
Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half

You made your choice now turn and get out
You made your choice now turn and get out

How do you sleep at night
It's all about you, it's all about you
How do you sleep at night
It's all about you, it's all about you

You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough
You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough

You left every one you loved
Crushed
Broken
Snapped straight in half




Burn everything you have
And leave it all behind
Lose all your inhibitions
I'll take the mess you made
And I'll make it beautiful
Oh if time only stood still for ever

Ohhh

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again

This moment that we're in
Is slow and disappointing
Time will never stand still for ever
If you take this chance we've got
We can make it beautiful
If you'd take my word
I'd be your saviour

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me

Ohhhhhhhh

Burn everything you have
And leave it all behind
Lose all your inhibitions
I took the mess you made
And made it beautiful
Oh if time only stood still for ever
For ever




I’m astounded I’m looking for a reason to leave
I’m astounded I’m looking for a reason to leave
The years I’ve put into everything I have
Everything I am

I’m needing to find some peace of mind
To stop me leaving it all behind
These eyes have seen everything
But I’ll keep looking

It’s time to realise that my head
Is trying to take me down
It’s time to realise that my head
Is trying to push
Trying to push me out

I’m screaming out for help
Months
Years
Nobody hears
I’m screaming out, I’m screaming out
It’s time to realise that my head
Is trying to take me down
I’m screaming out to no-one


I’m astounded still looking for a reason to leave
I’m astounded still looking for a reason to leave

The years I’ve put into everything I have now
The years that I’ve put into I am now

I’m needing to find some peace of mind
To stop me leaving it all behind
These eyes have seen everything
But I’ll keep looking

It’s time to take a step back
Look at my life and
Find a stable place to hide
It’s time to take a step back
Look at my life and find
A stable place to hide
It’s time to take a step back
Look at my life and
Find a stable place to hide
Stable place to hide

Live everyday like your last
And take nothing for granted
I’ll live everyday like my last
And I’ll take none of this for granted

Love as you want to be loved
And live the way that you know you should
Keep the good ones by your side
You never know when they might fly up and away

Forever in mind, my mind
I’ll be by your, your side
Forever in my mind, you’ll be there
