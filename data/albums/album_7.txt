We are beggars. We are so fucking weak.
And once upon a time, we had the world at our feet.
Well, we're all dying to meet our maker,
But all our Gods have abandoned us.

But all our Gods have abandoned us.
This is the great esoteric depression.
We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation.

We are all the shades of misery.
The reigning champions of tragedy.
They use their faith as a weapon,
They count our sins by the seven.
Black water at the gates of heaven.

All hail the corporatocracy.
The word of God is written in binary.
All hail our apostasy,
The dying notes in an unholy symphony.

But all our Gods have abandoned us.
This is the great esoteric depression.
We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation.

I found God clutching a razor blade.
He said, "Look at the fucking mess they've made."
They’d trade their hearts if they were made of gold

We are beggars. We are so fucking weak.
And once upon a time, we had the world at our feet.
Well, we're all dying to meet our maker,
But all our Gods have abandoned us.

All our Gods have abandoned us. [2x]

I found God clutching a razor blade.
He said, "Look at the fucking mess they've made.
They'd trade their hearts if they were made of gold,
But they're as worthless as the souls they sold."




There was a time for change, I fear it came and went.
Who's gonna pick up the pieces?
Who will be left to repent?
The sun is burnt out black.
Now there's no turning back.
Now there's no turning back.

Yeah, I know you know, we've been living a lie.
Turn a blind eye, until the day we die.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
Maybe we just want to watch the world burn.
We just want to watch the world burn.

Our collapse will be remission.
A planet scarred beyond all recognition.
Suicide in slow motion,
Is this the path that we've chosen?
Too cowardly to face this,
We've got a fucking death wish.

You want to play with fire?
Don't cry when you get burnt.
You gave us life, we gave back death in return.
The sun is burnt out black. Now there's no turning back.

We will consume until there's nothing left.
Remember us as a waste of breath.

Yeah, I know you know, we've been living a lie.
Turn a blind eye, until the day we die.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
Maybe we just want to watch the world burn.
We just want to watch the world burn.

I know you know, we've been living a lie.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
We just want to watch the world burn.

I want to believe that it all counts for something.
The writings on the wall.
It's hard to accept that it was all for nothing.
All for nothing.

Yeah, I know you know, we've been living a lie.
Turn a blind eye, until the day we die.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
Maybe we just want to watch the world burn.
We just want to watch the world burn.




Contaminated. Nothing is sacred.
Born and bred on pure hatred.
'Cause they haunt our streets with a phantom fear.
No one is safe, no one is welcome here, no one is welcome here.

Can you taste the poison in the air?
I swear it's everywhere, it's everywhere.
Hidden in plain sight, lost in black and white.
I'll chase the dying of the light.

They want the victims to hang their heads in shame,
Well fuck them all, we won't play their game.
We won't play their game.
I've seen through every word the prophets propagate.
This is a failed state.
So read between the lines. This is a failed state.

No love. No empathy.
Our fellow man is now our enemy.
No love. No unity.
Erase our souls, distort reality.

Can you taste the poison in the air?
I swear it's everywhere, it's everywhere.
Hidden in plain sight, lost in black and white.
I'll chase the dying of the light.

They will sow the seeds of blind contempt,
Then let us bleed until our heart's content.
Hidden in plain sight, lost in black and white.
I'll chase the dying of the light.

No love. No empathy.
Our fellow man is now our enemy.

No love. No empathy.
No love. No unity.
Our fellow man is now our enemy.




They want all for one and none for all.
I want to be there to witness the downfall.

They'll only sell us out once our backs are turned,
And we'll keep paying the price until our lesson is learnt.
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin.
Every snake has its price.
If the money's on the table they don't think twice.
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin.

We are paralyzed.
But there are none so blind as those who will not see.
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
'Cause you can see it in their eyes,
They don't give a fuck about what matters to us.

Another faceless figure, another empty silhouette.
They'll line their pockets and leave us six feet deep in debt.
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin.
Always out for blood, praying on the weak.
We can count on them to paint the future bleak,
But we're still standing by whilst they bleed us dry.

We are paralyzed.
But there are none so blind as those who will not see.
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
'Cause you can see it in their eyes,
They don't give a fuck about what matters to us.
So enough is enough.
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck.

[2x]
'Right' and 'wrong' it's all the same to me.
Thick as thieves as far as I can see.
They are leeches all,
But still we're standing by whilst they bleed us dry.

They want all for one and none for all.
I want to be there to witness the downfall.

We are paralyzed.
They want all for one and none for all.
I want to be there to witness the downfall.




The weight of the world is resting on thin ice.
When the surface breaks will I find paradise?
As I freeze to death, left to reflect,
What a waste of time I was, in retrospect.

I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve.
In the end, I'll get the hell that I deserve.

I'm always gone with the wind.
Crawling in and out of my mind.
God knows, I lost all my faith.

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me.
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate.
Annihilate me.

Do you remember when you said to me, "My friend, hope is a prison."?
Hope is a prison.

Of all the patterns that I could create,
I built a labyrinth with no escape.
To keep my 'self' under lock and key.
I am my own worst enemy.

I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve.
In the end, I'll get the hell that I deserve.

I'm always gone with the wind.
Crawling in and out of my mind.
God knows, I lost all my faith.

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me.
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate.
Annihilate me.

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me.
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate.
Annihilate me.

If I could silence all the doubt in me,
Accept what is meant to be, is meant to be.
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate.
Annihilate me.

I remember when you said to me, "My friend, hope is a prison."




Every moment is dead to me.

Do you remember? Because I can't forget.
The saddest story, of all that ever was, or will be.
Laid out before me. A living heart attack.
Play it back, play it back.

Take my eyes, I cannot see sense.
Past and future tense. Every moment is dead to me.
Safe and sound, anywhere but here.
I see it crystal clear, but it means nothing to me.

It means nothing to me. [2x]

Have you seen a future, filled with regret?
Breathe and count to ten. Start over again.
You want to run away. Just let yourself decay.
A living heart attack. Play it back, play it back.

The empty hourglass. We're going nowhere fast.
There's no more time to kill, if time is standing still.

Take my eyes, I cannot see sense.
Past and future tense. Every moment is dead to me.
Safe and sound, anywhere but here.
I see it crystal clear, but it means nothing to me.

It means nothing to me. [2x]

Play it back, play it back.
Over and over again, over and over again.

The empty hourglass. We're going nowhere fast.
There's no more time to kill, if time is standing still.




Tell me was it all worth it, to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven’t sunk this low.

So who’s left to count the cost?
Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost.
Now we’re gone, left without a trace.
But we took something they cannot replace.

A match made in heaven, paved the road to hell.
We’ve been down this path before.
Cold blooded retribution. So fuck your revolution.

You chew up peace and spit it out as war.
You’ve been feeding the wolf that’s waiting at the door.

You are rotten to the core.

We found your fingerprints all over the trigger.
If you’re looking for tyrants, take a look in the mirror.

You knew all along, that the cancer would spread.
So don’t be surprised to find a price on your head.

Sorry son, but we destroyed your home,
We murdered your family, now you’re on your own.
Collateral damage, face down in the sand.
Watch the dominoes fall, it’s all just part of the plan.

A match made in heaven. Paved the road to hell.
We’ve been down this path before.
Cold blooded retribution. So fuck your revolution.
And every execution, the price of your collusion.

You are rotten to the core.




This is a wake-up call. No rise without the fall.
Facing the great divide, you can run but you can't hide.
You can run but you can't hide.

I met the devil and God and couldn't tell them apart.
I thought I found the end, but it was only the start.

I've heard it all before.
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
Just let go. Gravity, hold on to me.

So come and wash us away.
Just thank fuck that we don't last forever.
It's now or never. Is this the catalyst?
Just let me burn the bridge, that leads me nowhere.
Because it's gone and it's never coming back.

So make no mistake,
It's just a matter of time before the wave breaks.
So stand your ground.
The earth will shake. So twist the knife,
'Cause I am finally awake.

So come and wash us away.
Just thank fuck that we don't last forever.
It's now or never. Is this the catalyst?
Just let me burn the bridge, that leads me nowhere.
Because it's gone and it's never coming back.

I've heard it all before.
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
Just let go.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
It's all you know.
Gravity, hold on to me.

So stand your ground.
The earth will shake. So twist the knife,
'Cause I am finally awake.




The workers all march to the beat of the drum.
Their spirits are broken, they have nowhere to run.
They dream of courage and a loaded gun,
But the slaves all know, they better bite their tongue.
Track marks across the planet.
Are there any veins left for them to infect?
They would kill one another just to disconnect.

Three cheers for desperation. God bless the Godforsaken.
We will arm them to the teeth, to fight the war on peace.

All love is lost, so carry the cross.
'Cause there's no human in us left.
We are music made for the deaf.
They play a game that they know they'll never win.
Sick and tired of the world they're living in.
The messiah showed up high on heroin.

The workers all march to the beat of the drum.
They fell into the trap, taken one by one.
The medicine is poison, but it makes them numb.
`Cause all that they feel is pain and regret.
Existence is just something they would rather forget.

Three cheers for desperation. God bless the Godforsaken.
We will arm them to the teeth, to fight the war on peace.

All love is lost, so carry the cross.
'Cause there's no human in us left.
We are music made for the deaf.
They play a game that they know they'll never win.
Sick and tired of the world they're living in.
The messiah showed up high on heroin.

Is this freedom? Is this the life you chose?
If this is living the dream, we've hit an all-time low.

All love is lost, so carry the cross.
'Cause there's no human in us left.
We are music made for the deaf.
They play a game that they know they'll never win.
Sick and tired of the world they're living in.
The messiah showed up high on heroin.




There is no endgame,
So whisper the truth and pass on the blame.
Just put us out of our misery.
This defeat is a victory.
We're burning out, we're fading away.
A failed evolution. Is the problem the solution
That they've been searching for?

We're waiting for the world to save itself.
`Cause nothing is built to last.
We're writing our epitaph.
So reset and start again.
'Cause we all know how this ends,
Before long we'll be dead and gone.

A thorn in the side of the earth.
Where do you draw the line?
A flaw in the design. The rest is history.
This defeat is a victory.
We're burning out, we're fading away.

[Excerpt by Michael Ruppert]

We're all guilty as sin. I feel it under my skin.
Always up in arms, without lifting a finger.

We may be infinite, but this world is not.
Something that we once knew, that we long forgot.

We're waiting for the world to save itself.

Always up in arms, without lifting a finger.

As above, so below.
Dismantled piece by piece,
What's left will not decease.
As within, so without.
The seasons bring relief.
Just let me live and die in peace.

I will be consumed, returned into the earth.
Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to.
Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow.
Cut the chord and cast me out.

It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Death is an open door.
It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Decay is the only law.

As above, so below.
Dismantled piece by piece,
What's left will not decease.
As within, so without.
The seasons bring relief.
Just let me live and die in peace.

[Excerpt]
"Change, and everything is change, nothing can be held onto.
To the degree that you go with a stream, you see, you are still.
You are floating with it. But to the degree that you resist the stream,
Then you notice that the current is rushing past you and fighting you.
So swim with it. Go with it. And you're there. You're at rest."

It'll wear you down, through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of it's own, has a mind of its own.
It'll wear you down, through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of it's own, has a mind of its own.

When my heart skips two beats, I am hidden deep, Fast asleep.
The sea will part, where the oceans meet. Finally complete.
It's a promise that you cannot break.

It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Death is an open door.
It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Decay is the only law.

Swan song.
A declaration of endlessness.
I swear I will not look back,
As I return into the black.
When the veil lifts, how will I know?
Will I see God?

As above, so below.
Dismantled piece by piece,
What's left will not decease.
As within, so without.
The seasons bring relief.
Just let me live and die in peace.

[Excerpt]
"You can't hang onto yourself. You don't have to try not to hang onto yourself.
It can't be done, and that is salvation.
Memento Mori; be mindful of death."
