An iron fist in a velvet glove.
Another vulture posing as a dove.
Do you have no shame? Look at what you've become.
You are the reason we are bitter and then some.
...bitter and then some.

They sing of saviours, we sing of sorrow.
But we're still holding on for dear life.

You sold us all down the river.
I hope you choke on the vows that you failed to deliver.
You said you'd change the world, but death still flies east.
The blind lead the blind, so we bomb for peace.

Gravedigger (gravedigger), there's blood on your hands.
You built this empire on salt and sand.
Not all is fair in love and war.
History repeats, we've seen this all before.
We've given the vampires the keys to the blood bank.

They say the more things change, the more they stay the same.
While the liars leech, the crooked preach.
So lie through your teeth, lie like you mean it.
It beggars belief, do you really think that we still fucking believe it?
You fucking parasite.
There's no room in here for an honest man,
only callous and cold hearts.

Gravedigger (gravedigger), there's blood on your hands.
You built this empire on salt and sand.
Not all is fair in love and war.
History repeats, we've seen it all before.

Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand.
Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand.

Say what you like, I know what I am
Sometimes a flood starts with a leak in the dam
You said we'll never make a difference
Maybe this battle is to fight indifference

Naysayer
Naysayer, hammer the nail
We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Betrayer, hammer the nail
Such narrow lines separate me and you

So sick of the sound of people giving up
You can't stop me giving a fuck
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on

With every concession another piece of us dies
Will we fight for nothing, if not our lives?
Apathy is our new messiah
Only he could let things get so dire
All the messengers found knives in their backs
Apathy is our new messiah
The word made flesh, you can't fight fire with fire
All the messengers found knives in their backs

I know it haunts you, it haunts me too
We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Why are we fighting, when I'm just like you?

Naysayer
Naysayer, hammer the nail

We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Betrayer, hammer the nail
Such narrow lines separate me and you

So sick of the sound of people giving up
You can't stop me giving a fuck
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on

Apathy is our new messiah
The word made flesh, you can't fight fire with fire




God only knows why we were born to burn

If God is my witness, he'll see that all is not well
Christ, what a sight for sore eyes
Looking down on us, all the children that you despise
God only knows why we were born to burn

God only knows why we were born to burn

A bullet in the neck doesn't feel much like love
A message of rejection sent from above
No flags, no holy books
I'll be in hell with the misunderstood

The sons and daughters that you wished to forget
A desperate picture of god's regret
Are we perfect mistakes? Or almighty fuck ups?
One thing's for sure, he doesn't fucking love us

He doesn't fucking love us

Hate must weigh on you like a broken cross
Hate; the dividing line we'll never step across

Outcast and reject, outcast and reject

Father, father, how I've let you down
A fucking tyrant in a hollow crown
Father, father, how I've let you down
A fucking tyrant in a hollow crown

The sons and daughters that you wished to forget
A desperate picture of god's regret
Are we perfect mistakes? Or almighty fuck ups?
One thing's for sure, he doesn't fucking love us
He doesn't fucking love us

He doesn't fucking love us




Hey, hey... They live this day and night.
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise.
Hey, hey... They have the heart to resist.
While the hunters hunt, they will persist.

This is where tragedy is bought and sold.
It seems their pain is worth it's weight in gold.
You know they're here when the water is red.
Our fading life support is hanging by a thread.

A message etched on broken ships.

Hey, hey... They live this day and night.
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise.
Hey, hey... They have the heart to resist.
While the hunters hunt, they will persist.

And you can hear them cry, they're calling out,
to their mother lost, she's bleeding out.
...she's bleeding out.

Their innocence is heaven sent.
Their malevolence, it will not relent.
A graveyard sits upon the shore.
They won't swim together anymore.

The tide will rush with waves of fear.
Selling souls, the devil is near.
The tide will rush in waves of fear.
Selling souls, the devil is near.
...the devil is near.

"If we're gonna survive on this planet, we have to
respect the rights of all those species to survive.
Cause we need them more than they need us."

A message etched on broken ships.
We'll be here til corruption quits.
There is a voice, though they cannot speak.
Not yet ready to admit defeat.

You can hear them cry, they're calling out,
to their mother lost, she's bleeding out.
You can hear them cry, they're calling out,
to their mother lost, she's bleeding out.

Their tragedy is bought and sold.
It seems their pain is worth it's weight in gold.




These martyrs seek no adoration.
No promises of god's salvation.
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet.
They hung the heroes. They hung the heroes.

You've got to watch your back.
You've got to swallow fear.
Cover your tracks, or you might disappear.
They found the words to speak unspeakable things.
And they struck the air from the chests of kings.

These martyrs seek no adoration.
No promises of god's salvation.
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet.
They hung the heroes. They hung the heroes.

If you were caught between the devil and the deep blue sea,
would you run and hide, or stand for what you believe?
Maybe Orwell was right all along.
They think this spells the end, it's only just begun.

These martyrs seek no adoration.
No promises of god's salvation.
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet.
They hung the heroes. They hung the heroes.

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun.
Swear that you won't forget.
Swear that you won't forget.

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun.
Swear that you won't forget.
Swear that you won't forget.

Tell the rats to get back in the gutter.
We'll be watching, we're always watching.

You try to stamp them out, you'll only fan the flames.
This is for all the snakes: Fuck you.
So hold your forked tongue.
You've got us spitting nails.
I'm gonna to say it straight. Fuck you.

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun.
Swear that you won't forget.
If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun.
They think this spells the end, it's only just begun.




"The old appeals to racial, sexual, and religious chauvinism, and to rabid nationalist fervor are beginning not to work. A new consciousness is developing which sees the Earth as a single organism, and recognizes that an organism at war with itself is doomed. We are one planet."
[- Carl Sagan]




No one knows permanence quite like you.
There's a ruthlessness in all that you do.
This is not about what we deserve.
There's no bias in the misery served.
C.A.N.C.E.R

So watch the sun sink into the sea.
There is a perfect peace, but don't wait up for me.

And when we all fade away,
And this world can't bare another day,
There will be no fight in broken bliss.
Respected will we be at the end of this.

I feel it now more than ever.
A reaper's watch. My life is ready to sever.

Your name carries more than disease.
A symbol of man brought to his knees.
This is not about what we deserve.
There's no bias in the misery served.
C.A.N.C.E.R

And when we all fade away,
And this world can't bare another day,
There will be no fight in broken bliss.

Find a little light and hold it close.
Don't lose sight, don't lose sight of what matters most.
Find a little light and hold it close.
Don't lose sight, don't lose sight of what matters most.

This is the burden we all carry together.
Waiting in the wings, so we never say never.

And when we all fade away,
And this world can't bare another day,
There will be no fight in broken bliss.
Respected will we be at the end of this.

So watch the sun sink into the sea.

Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.
We brought the battle, we saw the signs,
we've found ourselves two steps behind.

I'm counting days like they're running out.
There's ghosts in the water, so pray for drought.
(pray for drought)

This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse. This is colony collapse.

Give us the rope and we'll tie our own noose.
We truly believed all we touched turned to gold.
We were warned but we wouldn't be told.

I'm counting days like they're running out.
There's ghosts in the water, so pray for drought.

This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true. Say it isn't true.
The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?

1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse. This is colony collapse.
Colony collapse.

This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.
This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.

I've made promises that I know I can't keep.
Drink from the holy grail, you'll find it's bittersweet.
No matter what he says, poison is not my friend.
But he'll have my back until the bitter end.

Always climbing but only ever descending.
The canvas before me is never-ending.

So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods.
If I drop this torch then I'll be gone for good.
I said "enough is enough".
Well I guess I lied, I guess I lied.

This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.
This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.

All my mistakes will outlive me.
I just can't accept that what will be, will be.
My lungs are failing, I can't catch my breath.
I don't know why, but right now I'm scared to death.

My fear still sees when my eyes are closed.
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose.

So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods.

I wasted time building castles in the air.
If there's peace to be found, I won't find it there.
My fear still sees when my eyes are closed.
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose.

This is the path I chose. This is the path I chose.

The past is dead.
I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace.
The past is dead.
I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace.

If we stop the clock, will I reappear?
Pulled from the drift, there goes another year.
The stars align, the planets shift.
All the infinite moments that we've missed.

There's parts of me that are lost forever.
At least we're all lost together.
We all remember youth like it's dead and gone.
Like our favourite line from a forgotten song.

I'll show you my hurt and I'll show you my heart.
A life lost in the dark.

The past is dead.
I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace.
The past is dead.
I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace.

When I reach the end, will I beg for more?
Will I look back, or step through the door?
I stand beneath a monolith.
Do you ever feel like you won't be missed?

There's parts of me that are lost forever.
At least we're all lost together.
I heard that this was only a ride.
So there's no worth in waiting for death to arrive.

All we are, is just a name, it's all we are.
Our skin, it shows, these crippled bones.
Youth sinks alone.

All we are, is just a name, it's who we are.
Our skin, it shows, these crippled bones.
Youth sinks alone.

I'll show you my hurt and I'll show you my heart.
A life lost in the dark.

There's parts of me that are lost forever.
At least we're all lost together.

There's parts of me that are lost forever.




That distant blue, that's me and you.
It was from there that we all grew.
Framed in space, our first home.
All those beating hearts that were made of stone.
We were disaster built from flesh and bone.

Their bodies made a mountain, a ladder to the stars.
When they reached up to the sun, it only left them with scars.
All the saints and the sinners will reap what they sow.
So they stood back and watched their bitterness grow.

They couldn't tell the cure from disease.
They no longer knew their want from their need.
They fucked the future, forgot the past.
Nothing built was built to last.

A common ground, now we see,
that connected us like the land and the sea.

That distant blue, that's me and you.
It was from there that we all grew.
Framed in space, our first home.
All those beating hearts that were made of stone.
We were disaster built from flesh and bone.

Caught in a web, don't struggle free.
This is all we've got, so just let it be.
If we save ourselves, we'll feel so small.
We'll ask ourselves why we cared at all.

Caught in a web, don't struggle free.
This is all we've got, so just let it be.
