When In Troy
Do as the Greeks do
This is treacherous
This is cold hearted betrayal
Move in for the kill
And you’re all traitors
We’ll fight them to the death
Burn down the houses
Loot all the churches
And we found the time to pray
Pray that our justice be done
Pray by the light of the moon
That we’re not here




I will spill blood
On your filthy princess whites
Come home tonight
So I can slit your throat
Every time you discard my heart
Your ships sinking fast
The colours are fading
Save me again tonight, you know I’ll make it count
Princess, there’s more to life than robbing banks
You won’t walk away from this broken heart
Slash my arms
Tear off my limbs
I will never back down
To your sin




Been searching all day
For the answers
Do you remember when
Life was so simple?
They were shooting at us
After all this time
Shooting at us
Killing us all
And we’re all numb
Numb with the sound
Sound of our fears
We’re all numb
And just before you die
Take a look up at the sky
Tell them it was all worth it
They’ll Be Hanging Us Tonight
Raid all the liquor stores
Kidnap the kids
This night is not over yet
Burning on Lucifer’s blood
We’re trashed in the back of your car
A cheap lay in the parking lot
A shot for afterwards
As I watched you slaying behind the wheel
They’re gaining on us
A sharp turn left
Running out of time
They’re gaining on us
The lights flashed by
As we sped towards our escape
Nothing else mattered
Nobody else cared
They’ll be hanging us tonight
This was our masterpiece




Raid all the liquor stores
Kidnap the kids

This night's not over yet
Running on Lucifer's blood

We're trashed in the back of your car
A cheap lay in the parking lot
A shot for afters

Trashed in the back of your car
In the parking lot
Shot for afters

As I watched you slaying behind the wheel

They're gaining on us
A sharp turn left
Running out of time
They're gaining on us

This night's not over yet
Running on Lucifer's blood

The lights flashed by as we sped towards our escape
Nothing else mattered
Nobody else cared

They'll be hanging us tonight
This was our masterpiece




I close my eyes
And hold you in my arms
Despite all the pain
Your confessions means nothing




We’ll fight this cause
Even if it kills us
The temperature is rising
But our lungs will not collapse
Here in the desert
There’s nothing to run from
Nothing to hide from
So lets rock the casbah
Take it by the scruff of the neck
And if you’ve got the time, baby I’ve got the money
And I’d give anything to see her smile again
And I’d do anything for one last smile
She had a love like nobody else
Unrivalled beauty wanted them to love her back
When they didn’t she shed a tear
A piece of us all died that day
We all died that day




Piano wire strangling our necks
We are both silenced
And we’re sure this does not add up
Still we try and place our bets
We’re sure this does not add up
Still we’re dying
To make that call
Our people versus yours
Never did make sense
Your people versus mine
Light me up it’s all too much for me
Never did make sense, come dance with me
We’ll go out the sea, the sky was blood read
Images of people dead
Stained with the shadows
Of our past victims, we’re out at sea
Then come and drown with me
We’ll float away, drift away
Our corpses lifeless
Then somehow tell me we made sense




It’s getting hard to breathe in here
What I would give to be set free
This darkness surrounding me
They’re coming for us
They’re closing in
Take careful aim
I know you won’t miss
Avoid eye contact
Shoot the messenger
Pools of blood surround
Don’t run and hide this time
But we’ve made a mistake
A glaring error
We’re adrift
Nearly gone
And if you knew
You’d get away with it all what would you do?
In my darkened tomb, I am laid to waste
