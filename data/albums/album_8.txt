When I leave this skin and bone
Beyond my final heartbeat
I'll dismantle piece by piece
And I will know that death is not defeat
Holding on tight to what's left of our time
We've hidden away
But it's in the design
Why do we fight what we can't define?
Don't be afraid, we all cross the same line
Into the night we burn and rage
In death we repay for time on this stage
The lights are bright but don't lose your way
'Cause once it ignites
The flame must decay
Now you're finally complete
I will see you where oceans meet
Past and present merge
Light and dark will converge
Time will overthrow our reign on this throne
The everlasting sleep
Returning through the veil
Far beneath the deep
Another soul sets sail




Now the oceans have drained out
Can I come up for air?
'Cause I've been learning to live without
And I'm fighting with broken bones

I wasn't ready for the rapture
We're only passing through
But these words, they mean nothing to me
I know that time will mend this fracture

But I've been lost in a maze
And every route I take
Leads right back to you

Now the oceans have drained out
Can I come up for air?
'Cause I've been learning to live without
And I'm fighting with broken bones

Now the skies have been blacked out
I've got to find my way
'Cause it's been raining but there's a drought
And I'm fighting with broken bones

I've been searching through the wreckage
But it's like standing in the eye of a storm
When will I finally get the message?

Some things are broken beyond repair
This is my cross to bear
My own meaningless catastrophe
I never had the time to prepare
Because I never knew
That all my nightmares could come true

I've spent my fair share
In the deepest depths of despair
'Cause I was too lost down there to care
I wasn't braced for the fallout




I guess we're mortal after all!
One day all of us will give up the ghost
Too lost in the light to see what matters most
All ends will be met
And all worlds must collapse
Another part of the symphony
Lost between eternity
But God is in the detail
I know that there's a part of me
Doomed to face infinity 'Cause every wave has gotta break
The truth is all of us are hostages
Staring down the throat of the screaming abyss
Surrendering is half the battle
But we're powerless to resist
Have you forgotten the deal we made?
I've seen the end and the pain we trade
All these walls will fall
I guess we're mortal after all
The end will come for all of us
This all rests on a fault line
All ends will be met
And all worlds must collapse




Maybe we'll never learn
The fire at the gates is our saving grace
Remember, we were born to burn
There is a holy hell where can we save ourselves

There is a holy Hell
Where we can save ourselves

We will be cast out of paradise
It's a long ascent out of the black
But we all have to sacrifice
Hang the iconoclast
And kiss the feet of the amnesiac
'Cause the moment is dead when I'm lost in the past

Maybe we'll never learn
The fire at the gates is our saving grace
Remember, we were born to burn
There is a holy hell where can we save ourselves

But now the rivers are running red
And the skies have been set ablaze
I've been feeling the worst again
Heavenly terrorist, have you been mourning over yesterday
Don't forget to breathe when the knife begins to twist

Fuck this self pity, it's not that hard to see
We get one chance, these wounds will set me free
There's poison on the key, it brings you to your knees
But even the mountains erode in the rain

A single spark can start a forest fire
Light one match and burn down the empire
There's gold buried in the blue
Uh!
There's gold buried in the blue

Holy Hell, I've got nothing left to lose
And I can't tell there's gold buried in the blue

Maybe we'll never learn
The fire at the gates is our saving grace
Remember, we were born to burn
There is a holy hell where can we save ourselves

Holy Hell, I've got nothing left to lose
And I can't tell there's gold buried in the blue

But even the mountains erode in the rain

A single spark can start a forest fire
Light one match and burn down the empire
There's gold buried in the blue
There's gold buried in the blue




We suffer to survive
Are we desperate creatures crawling in the dirt?
Or are we lonely preachers
Hiding our beating hearts?
We sow the wind and reap the storm
Don't say you haven't been warned
No future's written
There's endless possibility
We suffer to survive
If hope is a prison
Then maybe faith will set me free
We suffer to survive
Am I just a victim?
Drifting in the raging sea
We suffer to survive
If a kingdom resides
Behind my own eyes
I've got to catch the stone and cradle the wave
Damnation is just a daydream away
But still we carry on
If I'm God in disguise
Praying for the rain
And if our demons decide
Then is this all in vain?
It's time to confess
I haunt this flesh
I answer my own prayers
I bid my own despair
There's a lesson in this
What I resist persists
And damnation, is just a daydream away




Royal beggars
Royal beggars
Do you
Do you
Do you wanna
Live forever
Live forever
Alone
Alone
Alone

'Cause we're broken
All hope is dead but we're coping (coping)
Somebody save our souls

Like a bird in a cage
Trying to fly away
Is this the price that we have to pay
Overflowing with rage
Yet we still obey
'Cause we're asleep in a hurricane

Bitter lovers
Bitter lovers
Let go
Let go
Let go 'cause it's
Now or never
Now or never
Breathe in
Breathe out
Breathe in

'Cause we're choking
And left for dead but we're coping (coping)
Somebody save our souls

Like a bird in a cage
Trying to fly away
Is this the price that we have to pay
Overflowing with rage
Yet we still obey
'Cause we're asleep in a hurricane

Are you listening, you may not have noticed
We have totally lost our way
Are you lost in the clouds or can you hold your focus
It's ourselves that we will betray

Are you listening, you may not have noticed
We have totally lost our way
Are you lost in the clouds or can you hold your focus
It's ourselves that we will betray

Like a bird in a cage
Trying to fly away
Is this the price that we have to pay
Overflowing with rage
Yet we still obey
'Cause we're asleep in a hurricane

We sit on a throne waiting for god to bend the knee
But we're nothing more than royal beggars

Yeah!

Uh, blegh!

But I'm as guilty as the next man
Our eyes are open but we're not listening




Seven billion hungry ghosts
Just a parasite killing its host
The emperor wears no clothes
I see those brittle bones

But we're buried by modern misery
There's not enough water in the world
To wash the blood from our hands
We planted a seed
Its roots will suffocate the soul
It grows without light
And feeds from our bones

Hell must be empty
All the devils are here
Singing us the Lord's Prayer
Finally, something that we all share

I won't go to the grave
With the song still in me
What are we hiding in the rain?
This is a prison for lost souls

Another life circles the drain
We used to run with the wolves
Now we can't see the forest
'Cause there's no light in the black hole

Don't try and tell me we are blessed
We used to run with the wolves
Are these our new messiahs?
'Cause the saviour has a gun to my head

Don't be fooled by Maya,
The kings are all thieves
And the serpents will bite as they please
How has it come to this?

I won't go to the grave
With the song still in me
And I won't live like a slave
Begging from my knees

I will not live like a slave
I will not beg from my knees
I will not go to the grave
With the song still in me
We used to run with the wolves




I found my way to the garden but I couldn't see
The cliff edge in front of me
No cloud can catch me now

It brings me closer to God
But keeps the dirt in the wound
And now the beast has teeth

I've got my hand on my heart
I thought that I knew the way
But I've been torn apart

Now I know there's a holy grail
But it's beyond the pale
Why must we always fly so close to the sun
The silhouettes have fallen one by one
'Cause we forget that the sun sets and we're not long for this world
No cloud can catch me now

The devil's recruit whispered in my ear
"Go tighten that noose" but it's clear
I've gotta follow the thread
Instead, I'll dream of the end and I will raise the dead

We're all refusing to feel
And yet we're dying to heal
But there is only now
And there's no easy way out

I found my way to the garden but I couldn't see
The cliff edge in front of me

Now I know there's a holy grail
But it's beyond the pale
Why must we always fly so close to the sun
The silhouettes have fallen one by one
'Cause we forget that the sun sets and we're not long for this world
No cloud can catch me now

I see no silver linings
When the days are so dark
So hold a flame to these words
Enough pressure will create a diamond
Uh!

I see no silver linings
When the days are so dark
So hold a flame to these words
Enough pressure will create a diamond
Enough pressure will create a diamond




Bleh!

I don't wanna dream anymore
I've buried it all too deep
Ah!
Every waking moment is war
This is the seventh circle
Bleh!

I'm stepping off the edge
I think I'd prefer oblivion
I feel the blood drain from my face
Maybe it's better to never have been

Too afraid to connect
What can I do to repent
I've got to settle my regrets
But first I've gotta accept
Some of us burn too bright
I'm holding on too tight
I think I'm done with reality

I don't wanna dream anymore
I've buried it all too deep
Every waking moment is war
This is the seventh circle
I don't wanna dream anymore
I've buried it all too deep
Every waking moment is war
This is the seventh circle
I don't wanna dream anymore
I've buried it all too deep
Every waking moment is war
This is the seventh circle




Remember when hell had frozen over?
The cold still burns underneath my skin
The water is rising all around me
And there is nothing left I can give

All these tears I've shed
I saw the wildfire spread
You said you cheated death
But heaven was in my head

They say the good die young
No use in saying what is done is done
'Cause it's not enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday

What will be will be
Every river flows into the sea
But it's never enough
And when the night gives way
It's like like a brand new doomsday

No matter what they say
It's like a brand new doomsday

The embers still glow when I'm sober
The gold in the flame burns brighter now
I have to rebuild now it's over
Maybe now I'm lost I can live
Souls don't break they bend
But I sometimes forget
I have to do this for you
And the only way out is through

Death is an open door
Words the prophets said
Still swimming through my head
Now there's no stars left in the sky
'Cause this well will never run dry

What if I completely forget?
What if I never accept?
'Cause when you fade away
It's like a brand new doomsday

They say the good die young
No use in saying what is done is done
'Cause it's not enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday

What will be will be
Every river flows into the sea
But it's never enough
And when the night gives way
It's like like a brand new doomsday

No matter what they say
It's like a brand new doomsday




(All is not lost)
(All is not lost)
(All is not lost)
(All is not lost)

(All is not lost)
(All is not lost)
(All is not lost)
(All is not lost)

Waited for a sign
Washed up on the shoreline
I'll always carry the cross
But all is not lost

(All is not lost)
I just can't relate
(All is not lost)
A crack the floodgate
(All is not lost)
Life comes at a cost
(All is not lost)
But all is not lost

Is this penance for my sins
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy ghost
Nothing lasts forever
Now it's time to sink or swim
I've got nothing except this wasted hymn
Holy ghost
Nothing lasts forever

Taking back what's mine
But it's lost to the skyline
A bridge I cannot cross
But all is not lost

(All is not lost)
Now there's no escape
(All is not lost)
God, what a sorry state
(All is not lost)
Love comes at a cost
(All is not lost)
But all is not lost

Is this penance for my sins
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy ghost
Nothing lasts forever
Now it's time to sink or swim
I've got nothing except this wasted hymn
Holy ghost
Nothing lasts forever

Can you feel the empty space
Can you feel the fire at the gates
Can you live a life worth dying for

Can you feel the empty space
Can you feel the fire at the gates
Can you live a life worth dying for

Can you feel the empty space
Can you feel the fire at the gates
Can you live a life worth dying for

Is this penance for my sins
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy ghost
Nothing lasts forever

Now it's time to sink or swim
I've got nothing except this wasted hymn
Holy ghost
Nothing lasts forever
