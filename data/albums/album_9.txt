No tree can grow to heaven
'Til its roots reach down to hell
Will we ever learn our lesson?
We all fall in parallel

No tree can grow to heaven
'Til its roots reach down to hell
Will we ever learn our lesson?
We all fall in parallel

Don't bury the confession
There's a light behind the shell
Do you dream of Armageddon
Just to get yourself to heaven?

We all fall in parallel
We all fall in parallel
We all fall in parallel
We all fall in parallel
We all fall in parallel




Do you cross your heart when you hope to die?
Are you sleeping deep in the hurricane?
IVs in the arm, forgetting to feel
We're crawling on all fours
Will you fall on that sword at the second coming?
You're gonna taste the ash and dust
'Cause this world is dying in our arms

Now the wheels are turning
What would you do to stay alive if the planet was burning?

You wanna make your hell a reality?
Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe
(If they dare to breathe, woah)
Sure sounds like heaven to me
You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds
No place to go if we don't believe
(If we don't believe, woah)
Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint

Give us a Judas steer we can deify
Yeah, we all pretend we're the renegades
So wash us away, garroted by a halo
Take a bow, 'cause time's running out
There's no doubt that the end is coming
You're gonna taste the ash, you're gonna taste the dust
'Cause this world is dying in our arms

Now the wheels are turning
What would you do to stay alive if the planet was burning?


You wanna make your hell a reality?
Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe
(If they dare to breathe, woah)
Sure sounds like heaven to me
You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds
No place to go if we don't believe
(If we don't believe, woah)
Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint

Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint

Post love, post truth, justice lays bound
And black bagged ready for the guillotine
We can all plead guilty when they ask
"Where were you when the Gods clipped the wings of the Phoenix?"
They clipped the wings of the Phoenix
When will we wrestle the world from the fools and their gold, and their fucking covenant?
We'll be waiting
Will enough be enough when we're holding on for dear life

You wanna make your hell a reality?
Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe
(If they dare to breathe, woah)
Sure sounds like heaven to me
You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds
No place to go if we don't believe
(If we don't believe, woah)
Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint
It's enough to plague a saint
It's enough to plague a saint
It's enough to plague a saint

We can all plead guilty when they ask
"Where were you when the Gods clipped the wings of the Phoenix?”




The Gospel, distorted
It leaves my blood running cold
But still they say
I'm rigging the ritual

I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers
Bleeding out like a devil in disguise
They shot a hole in the parachute
'Cause I'd rather feel alive

It's so convoluted
They're just trepanning for gold
May they rest in peace
'Cause they're fucking dead to me

Well there's your eulogy
The water's polluted
My feathers caught in the spill
Nobody said that it would be safe up here

I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers
Bleeding out like a devil in disguise
They shot a hole in the parachute
'Cause I'd rather feel alive

Your salvation's a let down
Oh I'm sorry that I'd rather feel
I'd rather feel alive

It leaves a mark on the mind
It weaves a web in the background
Silently
No time to spare
No sign of the exit wound
God help me
There's no drying off
Once you're soaked right down to the bone
Hopefully
Somebody thinks of me in the aftermath
Woe is me

It leaves a mark on the mind
It weaves a web in the background
Silently
No time to spare
No sign of the exit wound
God help me
There's no drying off
Once you're soaked right down to the bone
Hopefully
Somebody thinks of me in the aftermath
Woe is me

Woe is me
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry

I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers
Bleeding out like a devil in disguise
They shot a hole in the parachute
'Cause I'd rather feel alive

Your salvation's a let down
Oh I'm sorry that I'd rather feel
I'd rather feel alive




Oh, it just won't calculate
A prophecy with a twist
Do you really think Christ was a capitalist?
Every man for himself
Let thy neighbour drown
Amen

So sing us a sad song
So sing us to sleep
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues
Now discourse is dead

Stood at the tip of the wing
You've gotta watch where you tread

Round up the ambivalent
You mustn't sit in the shade
'Cause it's blasphemous
For one to abstain from hate
We're all sisters and brothers
But if you're one of the others
Then fuck you

So sing us a sad song
So sing us to sleep
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues

So save me the sermon
You all sound the same
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues

No common sense left in these empty heads
Swimming towards the storm
Two beating hearts
Two poles apart

No common sense left in these empty heads
Swimming towards the storm
Two beating hearts
Two poles apart

So sing us a sad song
So sing us to sleep
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues

So save me the sermon
You all sound the same
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues
Now discourse is dead

Stood at the tip of the wing
You've gotta watch where you tread
Don't look down
Let thy neighbour drown
Now discourse is dead




I wanna bother God
I wanna feel the ground beneath my feet
But I've got a smile full of broken teeth

Goodbye, all the doves have flown away
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself

I know it's not enough
Why does defeat always taste so bittersweet?
I just wanna live and die in peace

The flower that never blossoms is quickly forgotten
It must be gold if it's glistening
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself

Goodbye, all the doves have flown away
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself
Fly high 'cause the ravens are here to stay
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself in a cloud of

Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butter...
Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies

The flower that never blossoms is quickly forgotten
It must be gold if it's glistening
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself

Goodbye, all the doves have flown away
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself in a cloud of
Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies
Fly high 'cause the ravens are here to stay
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself in a cloud of
Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies




Do you feel at home in limbo?
Hiding a broken vow
A phantom at the window

Can you swallow the shame?
Has your courage been burnt out, faded away?
There won't be a saviour in sight, but it's okay
'Cause we're comfortable

We're stood at the edge of the world
Seize the snakes
They're living a lie, blinded by a candle
They're saying goodbye
We're stood at the edge of the world

When the clock runs down to zero
We'll stand up and take a bow
So quick to play the hero

Are you fanning the flames?
Are you torching the lighthouse?
Stood in way
Complicity burning so bright yet we delay
Are you culpable?

Seize the snakes
They're living a lie, blinded by a candle
They're saying goodbye
We're stood at the edge of the world

Drag the lake
When the water runs dry, we'll be slaves to the anchor
The Devil may cry
We're stood at the edge of the world

We're stood at the edge of the world

Nothing is holy
We all take the blame
Crumbling slowly
The cliff face belongs to the ocean
So run for your life

Do you remember the tip of the spear?
The edge of the knife?
We're freshly dismembered
But won't shed a tear
So run for your life

We're stood at the edge of the world
Seize the snakes
They're living a lie, blinded by a candle
They're saying goodbye
We're stood at the edge of the world

Drag the lake
When the water runs dry, we'll be slaves to the anchor
The Devil may cry
We're fighting to stay alive
How can we all survive?
No second chances
We're stood at the edge of the world

We're stood at the edge of the world, yeah
We're fighting to stay alive




We've got a choice but still we'd rather choose to suffer
'Cause there's no escape once the fuse is lit
Locked in this pantheon
Swimming with concrete shoes
The reaper comes to take the best of you
Can you see the writing on the wall?

There is a subtle space that we'll all discover
'Cause there is a seat reserved for the spirit
Passing through one by one
Riding a torpedo
We wash away into the overflow
Can you see the writing on the wall?

We're barricaded
'Cause nobody wants to meet their maker
The seeds are sewn then we die alone, we die alone
Eviscerated
We're all players in a symphony
That fights against impermanence
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again
Again, and again, and again!

Do you really wanna live forever?

We are so lost staring into all the colour
It hurts but reality is counterfeit
We came from the beyond
Living a cameo
One final breath and then we split in two
Can you see the writing on the wall?

We're barricaded
'Cause nobody wants to meet their maker
The seeds are sewn then we die alone, we die alone
Eviscerated
We're all players in a symphony
That fights against impermanence
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again

Even the doomed refuse
We were born to lose
Do you really wanna live forever?
'Cause those afraid to die will never truly live
They'll never truly live

Even the doomed refuse
We were born to lose
Do you really wanna live forever?

We're barricaded
'Cause nobody wants to meet their maker
The seeds are sewn then we die alone, we die alone
Eviscerated
We're all players in a symphony
That fights against impermanence
Again, and again, and again, and again

We are barricaded
'Cause nobody wants to meet their maker
The seeds are sewn then we die alone, we die alone
Eviscerated
We're all players in a symphony
That fights against impermanence
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again




There's a rose that blooms
Through the cracks in the concrete
Staining the prison floor
There's a pilgrimage waiting
Sat at the doorstep
Rotting beneath the sun

When there's nowhere left to hide, we'll be searching for a shortcut
Ire and denial are as thick as thieves
Soon there'll be nothing left of me, nothing left of me
Don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe
Tell me how to coexist when a fraction only wants war
Hopelessly in love with our gritted teeth
Soon there'll be nothing left of me, nothing left of me
Don't forget to breathe, I forgot to breathe
And look who's on the throne now

I'm a dead heretic
With no storm left to weather
Afraid to admit
It won't sustain the spirit
A new counterfeit
Like flight without feathers
Ready to submit
It won't sustain the spirit

It won't sustain the spirit


So we fall to our knees
And beg for reprieve
But it's almost time for the curtain call
The apostles will sing
And lead us from sin
But they hold all of our bones in their hands

We all swim against the tide until it puts us on the back foot
Nothing's ever taste half as good as grief
Soon there'll be nothing left of me, nothing left of me
Don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe
'Cause I'm staring at a fist and it's asking if I want more
Clarity will visit but it's only brief
Soon there'll be nothing left of me, nothing left of me
Don't forget to breathe, don't forget to breathe
Don't forget to breathe

I'm a dead heretic
With no storm left to weather
Afraid to admit
It won't sustain the spirit
A new counterfeit
Like flight without feathers
Ready to submit
It won't sustain the spirit

It won't sustain the spirit
It won't sustain the spirit
It won't sustain the spirit
It won't sustain the spirit




Burn the altar built by the dollar sign
Those waters are shallow
That's why the kids all say
'Get the fuck out of our way'
'Cause we're picking up the slack
Taking power back
Yeah, they made a bed out of our bones
Said it's all just overblown
It doesn't matter if you're friend or if you're foe
Do you really think you wanna be saved?

I wanna sing you a different song
One that's easier to swallow
(Everything is fucking fine)
We can dance we can all sing along
We can say how we all wanna be saved
But it's easier to follow

I wanna sing you a different song
One that's easier to swallow
We all say that we wanna be saved
But it's easier to follow

There are vultures preaching the party line
Those goldmines are hallowed
And if we look away then we'll all have hell to pay
So we cover up the tracks
There's no going back
Yeah, I know that Rome was overthrown
But it wasn't done alone
And you would think that we were better off below
Were you hoping that the dead could be raised?

I wanna sing you a different song
One that's easier to swallow
(Everything is fucking fine)
We can dance we can all sing along
We can say how we all wanna be saved
But it's easier to follow

I wanna sing you a different song
One that's easier to swallow
We can say how we all wanna be saved
But it's easier to follow

If we miss the deadline we can always blame the Divine
Gripping knives and praising lowlives
Nobody could say with a straight face
They didn't have it coming

They fucking had it coming
They fucking had it coming

I wanna sing you a different song
One that's easier to swallow
We can dance we can all sing along
We can say how we all wanna be saved
But it's easier to follow

I wanna sing you a different song
One that's easier to swallow
We'll say that we wanna be saved
If we miss the deadline we can always blame the Divine
Gripping knives and praising lowlives
Nobody could say with a straight face
They didn't have it coming




A diamond in the mud
Infinity is waiting there 'cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral

I do my best, but everything seems ominous
Not feeling blessed, quite the opposite
This shouldn't feel so monotonous
It never rains, but it pours

We're just a bunch of fucking animals
But we're afraid of the outcome
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in
Says I should pull the pin

Should I just pull the pin?
Should I just pull the pin?

I dug my heels, I thought that I could stop the rot
The ground gave way, now I've lost the plot
Fucked it again, that was all I've got
It never rains, but it pours
Life is just a dream within a

We're just a bunch of fucking animals
But we're afraid of the outcome
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in
Says I should pull the pin

Buried under dirt, a diamond in the mud
Infinity is waiting there 'cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral

Dream within a, dream within a

We're just a bunch of fucking animals
But we're afraid of the outcome
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in
Says I should pull the pin
We're just a bunch of fucking animals
But we're afraid of the outcome
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in
Says I should pull the pin

Should I just pull the pin?
Should I just pull the pin?
(Buried under dirt, a diamond in the mud)
Should I just pull the pin?
(Infinity is waiting there 'cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral)
Should I just pull the pin?




We are the rust worshipping the rain

Can I believe in anything
I've got a doubters mind
But that don't give me the rope
It's not enough
So call the cavalry
The cavalry
God give me some hope
'Cause I've been living in a deficit
For so long

Don't turn the page 'cause your blood'll run cold
Parting the seas isn't free and it's getting old
You're gonna choke when you drink from the fountain
We are the rust worshipping the rain
I've got a band aid on a bullet wound
If I refuse to break through, I can never lose
There's a trap at the peak of the mountain
We are the rust worshipping the rain

I'm so afraid of everything
I think my courage died
This is a slippy slope
So lock the cuffs
Because I'm powerless
So powerless
I just can't cope
'Cause I've been living in a deficit

A libertine
Stole the keys
And drove this machine
Without me

Don't turn the page 'cause your blood'll run cold
Parting the seas isn't free and it's getting old
You're gonna choke when you drink from the fountain
We are the rust worshipping the rain
I've got a band aid on a bullet wound
If I refuse to break through, I can never lose
There's a trap at the peak of the mountain
We are the rust worshipping the rain

A libertine
Stole the keys
And drove this machine
Without me

It's too much, but it's not enough
So cold, but I'm burning up
I'm trying to swim
But I'm treading water

Its unclear, but it's obvious
Three cheers for this emptiness
I'm trying to swim
Yeah, I'm trying
I'm trying
I'm trying

I'm treading water
'Cause I've been living in a deficit

Don't turn the page 'cause your blood'll run cold
Parting the seas isn't free and it's getting old
You're gonna choke when you drink from the fountain
We are the rust worshipping the rain

We are the rust worshipping the rain




Don't say we're better off dead
Soon we could be in remission
I said "it's not enough"
They told me "it'll be fine
Happiness isn't a crime son
So pick your guts from the floor"

We'll all be hanging a hero
Praying for someone to save us
Goliath says I oughta let it go

Nobody's proving me wrong
They're all singing hallelujah
Keep two eyes open
'Cause jackals live by the candlelight

We've got a mountain to climb
But I ain't got the permission
They wanna call my bluff
They said you're crossing the line
I said it takes one to know one

Oh, please God be merciful
'Cause they know not what they do
We should be begging for more
We'll all be hanging a hero
Praying for someone to save us
Goliath says I oughta let it go




I think I'm missing a piece of the puzzle
I could drown when I'm just stood in a puddle
A jet black reservoir sits beneath these scars
It's all I've ever known

Please applaud it's good to know who's below me
I keep on preaching but I'm so phony holy
I've been stuck on repeat
But I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

It feels like a glass half empty
Is more than I'll ever have
'Cause I've been fast asleep
Standing still in a stampede
I'm breaking my back
But I'm still sinking like a stone

Yeah, it's all that I've ever known
'Cause I've got nothing left
And I'm still sinking like a stone

I see the smoke but I don't move a muscle
Pretend I'm broken so you don't burst my bubble
I look up at the stars but don't see so far
It's all I've ever known

Can you spare me all of the ceremony?
Let's not pretend because I don't even know me
I've been dead on my feet
But I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

It feels like a glass half empty
Is more than I'll ever have
'Cause I've been fast asleep
Standing still in a stampede
I'm breaking my back
But I'm still sinking like a stone

Yeah, it's all that I've ever known
'Cause I've got nothing left
And I'm still sinking like a stone

This is déjà vu
But I'm a Demi God
I must've forgot I'm a Demi God
I always feel so blue
But I'm a Demi God
I must've forgot I'm a Demi God

This is déjà vu
But I'm a Demi God
I must've forgot I'm a Demi God
I always feel so blue
But I'm a Demi God
I must've forgot I'm a Demi God

Still sinking like a stone
Still sinking like a stone
Still sinking like a stone
It's all that I've ever known
Still sinking like a stone
Still sinking like a stone
'Cause I've got nothing left
And I'm still sinking like a stone

A glass half empty
Is more than I'll ever have
'Cause I've been fast asleep
Standing still in a stampede
I'm breaking my back
But I'm still sinking like a stone




This should be heavenly, heavenly
Is there no remedy, remedy?
'Cause I've been baring blunt teeth
I'm breathing heavily, heavily
I see a legacy, legacy that's sinking
Oh, it beggars belief

I'm standing beneath the meteor
Disaster's breaking down my door
I should be moving mountains
The arrow buckles in the bow
They said it's time to go to war
Yeah, I've heard it all before
I should be moving mountains
But I'm like fire in the snow

Bathing in gasoline, gasoline
Living in quarantine, quarantine
It's colder in the furnace
Nobodies evergreen, evergreen
Stare at the murder scene, murder scene and focus
On nothing but the surface

I'm standing beneath the meteor
Disaster's breaking down my door
I should be moving mountains
The arrow buckles in the bow
They said it's time to go to war
Yeah, I've heard it all before
I should be moving mountains
But I'm like fire in the, a fire in the

Snow, snow, snow, snow

Another God on the radio
Says we're stuck in a tailspin
The pilots have vertigo
They're lost in the undertow
The arrow buckles in the bow

They said we pushed the last domino
Before the apocalypse
We've all got a stone to throw
Why? I will never know
Yeah, we're like fire in the, a fire in the snow

I'm standing beneath the meteor
Disaster's breaking down my door
I should be moving mountains
The arrow buckles in the bow
They said it's time to go to war
Yeah, I've heard it all before
I should be moving mountains
But I'm like fire in the, a fire in the snow




From the cradle to the grave
Destined to break like the waves
Existence is so threatening

It takes a fierce grace to crack us open
A moment sat with our sentencing
And the light comes flooding in
Oh, the light comes flooding in
When the leaves fall in the spring

May all the beggars be blessed
Like angels with anhedonia
We're all just doing our best
Repeating 'there's nothing left'
That's why we weed out the wonderers
Maybe there's virtue in emptiness
But I still drown in distress
When the leaves fall in the spring

With the ravens here to stay
And the doves all flying away
Sedation feels so welcoming

In the subtle space there's an endless ocean
But the devils sing and it's deafening
What a world we're living in
Oh, we're never listening
When the leaves fall in the spring

May all the beggars be blessed
Like angels with anhedonia
We're all just doing our best
Repeating 'there's nothing left'
That's why we weed out the wonderers
Maybe there's virtue in emptiness
But I still drown in distress
When the leaves fall in the spring

I've got a lot to lose
But I won't lie to you
And make believe sincerity
I'm praying for a remedy

Beloved distant blue
One day I'll die for you
And swim in sweet serenity
'Cause death is not my enemy

I've got a lot to lose
But I won't lie to you
And make believe sincerity
I'm praying for a remedy

Beloved distant blue
One day I'll die for you
And swim in sweet serenity
'Cause death is not my enemy
