I've been out for so long, the days slipped by again
And I can't sleep since I stopped caring [x2]
I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
And I can't tell daylight from streetlights any-fucking-more
As he cast his shadow

I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't look back
And I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't, I'm not looking back

This is so unfamiliar; death is no man's friend
And I'll stay here until I hear him roar
Death is screaming my name yet
I refuse to listen to him [x2]

I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
To listen

I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
And I can't tell daylight from streetlights any-fucking-more
As he cast his shadow

I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't look back
And I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't, I'm not looking back

I can't sit here forever
Watch me rise again
Watch me rise back up
Forever would just be so easy to fall into [x2]
Yet I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
Forever is the easy option but I won't take it
I won't take it, no

The choices I've made will lead me to an early fucking grave

Death is screaming,
Death is screaming,
Death is screaming, my fucking name




Another cold dark night, left alone
Your arrogance will lead to the death of you
I'll be the one to pull your head back down
Remove your hollow Crown
So far from the truth you hide away
I'll be the one to pull your head back down
Remove your hollow crown
I'll die happy knowing that I will never be anything like you
What gives you the right to silence me?
All my life I've wanted just to fell like this
You came, you conquered you gave it away
And how does it feel staring down on your idol's grave
The one you once looked up to has fallen into dust
The one you once looked up to has fallen away
What's left for you in this fickle world?
Remove your crown




Every other question you'll never find the answer to
They can hear us but we will never see them

Do you feel safe?
Do you even understand me?
Do you even understand me?

We make no difference when numbers count for nothing
We make no difference if choices have been made
When your path has already been walked
When your hourglass is fooling you

What can you rely on?
Time is our only friend, now

If my life was to end today, It wouldn't change the world in any way

This sudden realisation is tearing me apart
This life is so perfect
What can be said of the end?
What will happen when our time comes
Who will stand the final test of time?

This life is so perfect
What can be said of the end
Will we be resurrected?
Who will stand the final test?




Can I blame it on you?
I just can't win

Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds
Can't seem to find a good excuse this time, for me and for this to fall apart
Shall I blame it on myself, or this routine that I've been stuck in?

I've lost count of how many times I've tried to get out of this routine
But it's holding so tight

I just can't handle another day of this
I just can't win

Get me out alive

Oh God, I mean it
These are violent days for you and me
I just can't handle another day of this routine

Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds
I've found my excuse this time
Your words are wearing me down
A constant frown upon my back

Follow the water
Drain the lake and bring it back to me




take your time to find me
I can't promise where I'll be
these nights I felt so restless
tonight I feel useless

take your time to find me
I can't promise where I'll be
these nights I feel so restless
tonight I'm useless

blaming myself
for every woman
I should have thought this through
before I hold you down with me
motionless I lay
when your words could save me from
this situation

I've been laying here for what seems
like days
and it was my mistake from the start

take your time to find me
I can't promise where I'll be
it was my mistake from the start

take your time to find me
I can't promise where I'll be
it was my mistake from the start

motionless I lay
when the words that saved me
staring back into
dead sunk eyes?

I need the right words to come...
I need the the right words
but I just can't find it
I just can't find it

I'll spend years
making you believe
I was just a bad dream
just a bad dream

and it was my mistake from the start
I've been laying here for what seems
like days

take your time to find me
I can't promise where I'll be
it was my mistake from the start

take your time to find me
I can't promise where I'll be
it was my mistake from the start

I'm determined
to find a way, out
to disconnect myself
from you, again

how can I
have shattered
my one chance
ooow, to you
how can I
feel like I'm
shattered my
ooohooo

to me
I'll spend years
making you believe
that I was only a bad dream

I'm determined
to find a way, out
to disconnect myself
from you, again

how can I
have shattered
my one chance
ooow, to you
how can I
feel like I'm
shattered my
once chance tonight




I am your hero
Still I sleep alone at night
In years you'll thank me
For getting everything right
I am the sun
Still I sit alone in a red sky
Keeping my eyes on you
Were all alone

In time you'll find that
Were all on our own (all on our own)
Were all on our own , chasing nothing
My dreams have fallen , I'm wearing thin
I need something to fill this void I'm constantly in
And I can't do this

I am your hero
I just don't care tonight
In years you'll forget me
I got everything right
I am the sun
I didn't rise today
I left you in darkness

And I just don't care anymore about you
You can sit and suffer alone without me

I am your hero
Save your "thank you"'s

In times to come ill rise above this
But for now I can't ill just sit here
My dreams have fallen once again
My dreams have fallen once again

I need something to fill this void I'm in




I'm looking back on a time when I could say I actually thought I cared about you
But after everything I've been put though
I realise that I've been living with false hope
It's drowning out my senses
It's drowning out my thoughts
This has got oh so confusing
And I've only got myself to blame
I can't believe...oh what was I thinking
I've only got my self to blame
You mean nothing to me
And you never fucking did
I can't stand to listen to your excuses anymore
I can only pray that you feel so alone
A guilty conscience hangs over your head
I can't believe...oh what was I thinking
I've only got myself to blame
But maybe I'm the only one to blame in all of this
I've got nothing to depend on anymore




After all is said and done
I'm left with reflections of your eyes haunting my mind
So dead inside, what good came out of this?
I was the one that tore you down
I'm down yet oh so guilty
Every last breath I have is yours to keep
This constant cloud is watching over me
I wish I had the time to make you see this through
We've been here too many times
I've felt like this too many times
Oh god, I am this I'm dead inside, looking out for you
And your final words I was the one that tore you down




I admire your perseverance!

Everytime my back is turned your falling closer into my world,
I've told you so many times you need to back down, need to back down.

I told you you need to walk away.
All the countless efforts I have made.
One day I'll get you back, I swear I'll get you back.

Will this ever end or will time stand still forever?
Will this ever end or will time stand still forever?

Everytime my back is turned you're falling closer to my world.
How can you sleep when you know what you're doing to me?

Everytime my back is turned you're falling closer to my world.
How can you sleep when you know what you're doing to me?

I told you you need to walk away
Fuck all the efforts that I have made.
I've got you right where I want you.

After all the years I've known you when did you decide to fuck this up?
After all the years I've known you when did you decide to try and fuck this up?

I still admire your perseverance!

How did you think you'd get away with this?!

And it's time to teach you a lesson that you're never gonna fucking forget!
You are never gonna forget, not any time soon!
You're never gonna forget me!
Brargh!




I've watched you from a distance but never spoken a word
I have seen every flaw your try to hide from the world
I sit silent in shadows watching the paths you have made
If only you knew my intentions
I've watched you make the same mistakes over and over
This is not healthy
I need to some how stop this
But your beauty intrigues me
It seems to be pulling me in
All I want is a moment or something I can hold close for eternity
I've watched you make the same mistakes over and over
I only you knew my name and all of my motives
Yet I sit in the same place every night and wait for you to come back home
A few moments would help me find myself
But this problem has taken its tragic grip
Just a few moments will help me find myself again
If only you knew my name and all of my motives
I need to somehow stop this
All I need is a moment or something I can hold close for eternity
Something I can hold close to me




It feels like someone is following my every footstep around every corner,
And there are times when I know I've felt someone else with me.

I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.
I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.

I'm never giving up till I find you.
I'll never rest until I find you.

I refuse to rest and I refuse to sleep until I have you in my sights.
It's gone too far.
A few steps behind.
Where are you now?

What is the meaning, why are you doing this to me?
What is the meaning, why are you doing this to me?

How can you do this?
I'll never sleep until I find you.

I swear I've felt your presence once before,
Or has my paranoia gone far too far?

I can't close my eyes without thinking that I'm losing control!
I can't close my eyes without thinking that I'm losing control!

I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.
I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.

I'm never giving up till I find you.
I'll never rest until I find you.
I'll never rest and I'll never sleep till I get my hands around your neck.
It's gone too far. A few steps behind. I'm coming for you now.

All I seem to hear in my head is your voice on repeat,
I close my eyes and I still fucking see you.
All I seem to hear in my head is your voice on repeat,
I close my eyes and I still fucking see you there!




There, there must be
An easier way
To release these feelings

So, so far from home
I need your voice
To hold my head together

So, so far from home
I need your voice
To lift my lonely state of mind

You, you can but wait
for me to return
For me to show you how I felt

These wounds have bled
And pages fly by
I need to feel you right by my side

So, so far from home
I need your voice
To hold my head together

So, So far from home
I need your voice
To lift my lonely state of mind

Oh there must be
An easier way
Oh there must be
An easier way
Oh there must be
An easier way
To release these feelings

As the sea breeze hits my lungs
It takes me back to where I belong
To where I belong

As the sea breeze hits my lungs
It takes me back to where I belong
To where I belong

As the sea breeze hits my lungs
It takes me back to where I belong
To where I belong
