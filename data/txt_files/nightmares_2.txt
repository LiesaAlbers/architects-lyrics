I will spill blood
On your filthy princess whites
Come home tonight
So I can slit your throat
Every time you discard my heart
Your ships sinking fast
The colours are fading
Save me again tonight, you know I’ll make it count
Princess, there’s more to life than robbing banks
You won’t walk away from this broken heart
Slash my arms
Tear off my limbs
I will never back down
To your sin
