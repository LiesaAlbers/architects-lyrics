It’s getting hard to breathe in here
What I would give to be set free
This darkness surrounding me
They’re coming for us
They’re closing in
Take careful aim
I know you won’t miss
Avoid eye contact
Shoot the messenger
Pools of blood surround
Don’t run and hide this time
But we’ve made a mistake
A glaring error
We’re adrift
Nearly gone
And if you knew
You’d get away with it all what would you do?
In my darkened tomb, I am laid to waste
