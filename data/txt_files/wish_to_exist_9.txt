Burn the altar built by the dollar sign
Those waters are shallow
That's why the kids all say
'Get the fuck out of our way'
'Cause we're picking up the slack
Taking power back
Yeah, they made a bed out of our bones
Said it's all just overblown
It doesn't matter if you're friend or if you're foe
Do you really think you wanna be saved?

I wanna sing you a different song
One that's easier to swallow
(Everything is fucking fine)
We can dance we can all sing along
We can say how we all wanna be saved
But it's easier to follow

I wanna sing you a different song
One that's easier to swallow
We all say that we wanna be saved
But it's easier to follow

There are vultures preaching the party line
Those goldmines are hallowed
And if we look away then we'll all have hell to pay
So we cover up the tracks
There's no going back
Yeah, I know that Rome was overthrown
But it wasn't done alone
And you would think that we were better off below
Were you hoping that the dead could be raised?

I wanna sing you a different song
One that's easier to swallow
(Everything is fucking fine)
We can dance we can all sing along
We can say how we all wanna be saved
But it's easier to follow

I wanna sing you a different song
One that's easier to swallow
We can say how we all wanna be saved
But it's easier to follow

If we miss the deadline we can always blame the Divine
Gripping knives and praising lowlives
Nobody could say with a straight face
They didn't have it coming

They fucking had it coming
They fucking had it coming

I wanna sing you a different song
One that's easier to swallow
We can dance we can all sing along
We can say how we all wanna be saved
But it's easier to follow

I wanna sing you a different song
One that's easier to swallow
We'll say that we wanna be saved
If we miss the deadline we can always blame the Divine
Gripping knives and praising lowlives
Nobody could say with a straight face
They didn't have it coming
