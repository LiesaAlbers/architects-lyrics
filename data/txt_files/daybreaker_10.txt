The sick get sicker while the rich get richer.
Capital greed paired with vestigial superstition.
The sick get sicker while the rich get richer.
Angels and demons, money and munitions.
Your left wing clipped,
buy a gun for jesus.
Opportunities for all those willing to pay.
Out of sight, out of mind,
too afraid of the horror that you might find.
Out of sight, out of mind.
How much does your faith cost?
Celestial shepherd watches over his flock.
What about those black sheep that he forgot?
Unanswered faith is everything that they’ve got.
I’d like to think you’re everything that I’m not.
Something here doesn’t add up.
Your charity starts and ends at home.
Your conscience called but you hung up the phone.
