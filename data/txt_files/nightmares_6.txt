We’ll fight this cause
Even if it kills us
The temperature is rising
But our lungs will not collapse
Here in the desert
There’s nothing to run from
Nothing to hide from
So lets rock the casbah
Take it by the scruff of the neck
And if you’ve got the time, baby I’ve got the money
And I’d give anything to see her smile again
And I’d do anything for one last smile
She had a love like nobody else
Unrivalled beauty wanted them to love her back
When they didn’t she shed a tear
A piece of us all died that day
We all died that day
