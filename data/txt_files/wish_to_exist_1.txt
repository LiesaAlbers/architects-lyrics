No tree can grow to heaven
'Til its roots reach down to hell
Will we ever learn our lesson?
We all fall in parallel

No tree can grow to heaven
'Til its roots reach down to hell
Will we ever learn our lesson?
We all fall in parallel

Don't bury the confession
There's a light behind the shell
Do you dream of Armageddon
Just to get yourself to heaven?

We all fall in parallel
We all fall in parallel
We all fall in parallel
We all fall in parallel
We all fall in parallel
