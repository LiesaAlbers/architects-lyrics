Don't say we're better off dead
Soon we could be in remission
I said "it's not enough"
They told me "it'll be fine
Happiness isn't a crime son
So pick your guts from the floor"

We'll all be hanging a hero
Praying for someone to save us
Goliath says I oughta let it go

Nobody's proving me wrong
They're all singing hallelujah
Keep two eyes open
'Cause jackals live by the candlelight

We've got a mountain to climb
But I ain't got the permission
They wanna call my bluff
They said you're crossing the line
I said it takes one to know one

Oh, please God be merciful
'Cause they know not what they do
We should be begging for more
We'll all be hanging a hero
Praying for someone to save us
Goliath says I oughta let it go
