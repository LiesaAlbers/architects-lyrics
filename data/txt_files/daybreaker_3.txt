These streets aren’t pave with gold
Don’t believe everything that you’re told
Deception hides in all you see
Corruption hides in the air that you breathe
And in the land of the free
You know nothing comes for free
Fourth drive in paradise
Vapid souls check the market price
Lifetime slave living in a suburban grave
If there was a god you, was a god
You would be the death of him
These colours don’t run like colour from the face
Eyes roll back chemical despair
It’s true what they say
Life isn’t fair
So repeat this line
Everything, everything is fine
So repeat this line
Everything, everything is fine
These colours don’t run like colour from the face
Eyes roll back chemical despair
It’s true what they say
Life isn’t fair
And in the land of the free
You know nothing comes for free
I’m struggling to find any poetry in this
Someone beat me to the line ignorance is bliss
So I guess I’ll just say it how it is
You had it all you fucking pigs

These streets aren’t pave with gold
Don’t believe everything that you’re told
Deception hides in all you see
Corruption hides in the air that you breathe
