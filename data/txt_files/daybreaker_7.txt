I close my eyes and take a deep breath,
try to find my place in this.
Digging teeth into the hand that feeds,
so inhuman, I’m surprised you bleed.
Cutting teeth, fading belief.
Flip the switch and drag me in.
When they’ve had their way,
I doubt I’ll even dream.
Stray from the path and you’re on your own.
Lightening strikes in the unknown.
The view from here, even the blind would see,
that none of us were ever free.
I’ll be the lines in-between,
the ones that tell you what you want and need.
I am only rust on the machine,
amber corrosion.
The loudest truth you never heard,
a silent explosion.
Take my head from the clouds,
lift my feet from the ground,
Last note dies, they don’t make a sound.
