I’m astounded I’m looking for a reason to leave
I’m astounded I’m looking for a reason to leave
The years I’ve put into everything I have
Everything I am

I’m needing to find some peace of mind
To stop me leaving it all behind
These eyes have seen everything
But I’ll keep looking

It’s time to realise that my head
Is trying to take me down
It’s time to realise that my head
Is trying to push
Trying to push me out

I’m screaming out for help
Months
Years
Nobody hears
I’m screaming out, I’m screaming out
It’s time to realise that my head
Is trying to take me down
I’m screaming out to no-one


I’m astounded still looking for a reason to leave
I’m astounded still looking for a reason to leave

The years I’ve put into everything I have now
The years that I’ve put into I am now

I’m needing to find some peace of mind
To stop me leaving it all behind
These eyes have seen everything
But I’ll keep looking

It’s time to take a step back
Look at my life and
Find a stable place to hide
It’s time to take a step back
Look at my life and find
A stable place to hide
It’s time to take a step back
Look at my life and
Find a stable place to hide
Stable place to hide

Live everyday like your last
And take nothing for granted
I’ll live everyday like my last
And I’ll take none of this for granted

Love as you want to be loved
And live the way that you know you should
Keep the good ones by your side
You never know when they might fly up and away

Forever in mind, my mind
I’ll be by your, your side
Forever in my mind, you’ll be there
