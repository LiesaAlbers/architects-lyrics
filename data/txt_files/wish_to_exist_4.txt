Oh, it just won't calculate
A prophecy with a twist
Do you really think Christ was a capitalist?
Every man for himself
Let thy neighbour drown
Amen

So sing us a sad song
So sing us to sleep
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues
Now discourse is dead

Stood at the tip of the wing
You've gotta watch where you tread

Round up the ambivalent
You mustn't sit in the shade
'Cause it's blasphemous
For one to abstain from hate
We're all sisters and brothers
But if you're one of the others
Then fuck you

So sing us a sad song
So sing us to sleep
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues

So save me the sermon
You all sound the same
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues

No common sense left in these empty heads
Swimming towards the storm
Two beating hearts
Two poles apart

No common sense left in these empty heads
Swimming towards the storm
Two beating hearts
Two poles apart

So sing us a sad song
So sing us to sleep
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues

So save me the sermon
You all sound the same
'Cause we all dance around the carousel
Chewing through our tongues
Now discourse is dead

Stood at the tip of the wing
You've gotta watch where you tread
Don't look down
Let thy neighbour drown
Now discourse is dead
