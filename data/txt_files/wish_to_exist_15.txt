From the cradle to the grave
Destined to break like the waves
Existence is so threatening

It takes a fierce grace to crack us open
A moment sat with our sentencing
And the light comes flooding in
Oh, the light comes flooding in
When the leaves fall in the spring

May all the beggars be blessed
Like angels with anhedonia
We're all just doing our best
Repeating 'there's nothing left'
That's why we weed out the wonderers
Maybe there's virtue in emptiness
But I still drown in distress
When the leaves fall in the spring

With the ravens here to stay
And the doves all flying away
Sedation feels so welcoming

In the subtle space there's an endless ocean
But the devils sing and it's deafening
What a world we're living in
Oh, we're never listening
When the leaves fall in the spring

May all the beggars be blessed
Like angels with anhedonia
We're all just doing our best
Repeating 'there's nothing left'
That's why we weed out the wonderers
Maybe there's virtue in emptiness
But I still drown in distress
When the leaves fall in the spring

I've got a lot to lose
But I won't lie to you
And make believe sincerity
I'm praying for a remedy

Beloved distant blue
One day I'll die for you
And swim in sweet serenity
'Cause death is not my enemy

I've got a lot to lose
But I won't lie to you
And make believe sincerity
I'm praying for a remedy

Beloved distant blue
One day I'll die for you
And swim in sweet serenity
'Cause death is not my enemy
